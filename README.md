# Foundation Algorithms (Python)

This repository contains my **daily algorithm practice using Python**.  
The main goal is to build **strong programming foundations**, improve **logical thinking**, and develop **problem-solving skills** step by step.

### Day 01
- **positive_negative.py**  
  Determines whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **sum_of_digits.py**  
  Calculates the sum of digits of a given number.

### Day 02
- **even_or_odd.py**  
  Checks whether a number is even or odd.

### Day 03
- **max_of_three_numbers.py**  
  Finds the maximum of three numbers, including cases where values are equal.

### Day 04
- **grade_evaluation.py**  
  Evaluates a grade based on given conditions.
- **divisible_by_5_and_10.py**  
  Checks whether a number is divisible by 5 and 10.

### Day 05
- **calculator.py**  
  A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) with division-by-zero handling.
- **fizz_buzz.py**  
  A FizzBuzz mini project that checks divisibility by 3 and 5.
