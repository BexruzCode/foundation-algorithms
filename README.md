# Foundation Algorithms

This repository contains my daily algorithm practice using Python.
I am focusing on building strong programming foundations and logical thinking.

## Repository Structure

- day01
  - positive_negative.py  
    Checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
  - sum_of_digits.py  
    Calculates the sum of digits of a given number.

- day02
  - even_or_odd.py  
    Checks whether a number is even or odd.

## Learning Goals

- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Practice problem solving with Python
- Build a strong foundation for software development
- Track daily progress on GitHub

## Progress

- Day01 ✅ Basic conditions and loops  
- Day02 ✅ Even / odd logic and functions
