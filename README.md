🧠 Foundation Algorithms (Python)

This repository contains my daily Python algorithm practice.
The goal of this project is to build strong programming foundations, improve logical thinking, and develop problem-solving skills step by step.

📁 Repository Structure

📅 Day 01

positive_negative.py
Determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

sum_of_digits.py
Calculates the sum of digits of a given number.

📅 Day 02

even_or_odd.py
Checks whether a given number is even or odd.

📅 Day 03

max_of_three_numbers.py
Finds the maximum of three numbers, including cases where values are equal.

📅 Day 04

grade_evaluation.py
Evaluates a grade based on given conditions.

divisible_by_5_and_10.py
Checks whether a number is divisible by both 5 and 10.

📅 Day 05

calculator.py
A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations
(+, -, *, /) with division-by-zero handling.

fizz_buzz.py
A FizzBuzz mini project based on divisibility by 3 and 5.

📅 Day 06

print_numbers_from_1_to_n.py
Prints numbers from 1 to N using a while loop.

sum_numbers_1_to_n.py
Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N using a while loop and a function that returns the result.
